1️ Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

Inventory and order management is a core challenge in retail, wholesale, e-commerce, and manufacturing industries. Businesses often face:

a) Inaccurate stock tracking (leading to overstocking or stockouts).

b) Manual order handling causing delays and errors.

c) Lack of visibility into sales performance.

By leveraging Salesforce CRM, we can provide a centralized platform for inventory tracking, automated order processing, and real-time reporting. This ensures efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.

2️ Requirement Gathering

For this project, the requirements were gathered by considering the needs of a small to mid-sized business. Key requirements include:

a) Ability to add/update products with stock quantity.

b) Track customer orders linked to products.

c) Automatically reduce stock levels when an order is confirmed.

d) Generate low-stock alerts when products reach threshold.

e) Provide sales insights via reports and dashboards.

3️ Stakeholder Analysis

The system involves the following key stakeholders:

a) Sales Representatives → Create orders, view product availability.

b) Inventory Managers → Update stock levels, monitor low stock.

c) Sales Managers/Executives → Approve high-value orders, analyze reports.

d) Customers (Indirect Stakeholders) → Benefit from faster and more reliable order processing.

4️ Business Process Mapping

The business flow can be mapped as:

a) Product Setup → Add products with stock details.

b) Order Creation → Sales rep creates customer orders.

c) Stock Adjustment → System reduces stock when order is confirmed.

d) Approval Process → Orders above a threshold trigger manager approval.

e) Reporting → Managers view dashboards for inventory levels, sales trends, and performance.

This flow ensures end-to-end management of inventory and order fulfillment.

5️ Industry-specific Use Case Analysis

This project applies to multiple industries:

a) Retail/E-commerce → Manage product catalog, customer orders, discounts.
 
b) Wholesale/Distribution → Bulk orders, stock movement, warehouse tracking.

c) Manufacturing → Track raw materials and finished goods inventory.

Each industry benefits from Salesforce’s scalability and automation features for order processing.

6️ AppExchange Exploration

Salesforce AppExchange has several inventory/order management apps (e.g., Rootstock Cloud ERP, Accounting Seed, Propel).
For this project:

a) We explored how these apps handle stock, orders, and workflows.

b) Instead of installing a full ERP app, we built a custom lightweight version tailored for beginners.

c) This approach helps understand Salesforce fundamentals before moving to enterprise-level apps.
