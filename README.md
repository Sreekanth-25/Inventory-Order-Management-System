# Inventory-Order-Management-System
Small and medium-sized businesses often struggle to keep track of their product inventory and manage customer orders effectively. Manual tracking using spreadsheets or offline tools can lead to:

1) Stock mismatches (overselling or underselling products).

2) Delays in order approvals due to lack of automation.

3) Poor visibility into sales performance and low-stock alerts.

To address these challenges, we propose building a Salesforce-based Inventory & Order Management System.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Maintain a centralized product catalog with available stock.

Allow users to create and manage customer orders linked to products.

Automate the order approval process (e.g., high-value orders require manager approval).

Trigger low-stock alerts when inventory drops below a threshold.

Provide reports and dashboards to track sales, stock levels, and order trends.

âœ… Expected Outcome

A Salesforce application where businesses can:

Add/update products with current stock levels.

Create and track customer orders.

Automatically reduce stock when orders are fulfilled.

Get real-time insights through dashboards.

This system will simplify inventory tracking, reduce errors in order processing, and improve overall sales efficiency.
